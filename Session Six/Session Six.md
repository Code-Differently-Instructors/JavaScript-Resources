## About

In this unit, you will learn what Nav is all about. You will also learn what is nav, how to style a navigation bar, and margin and padding.


## How to use

This will serve as the demonstration instructors will give in regards to what students/employees have learned whether in Treehouse or otherwise. The "Instructor Explains/Demonstrates" section is for the instructor to explain the following topic and there are pre-made examples to use for demonstration purposes. The "Junior Devs Demonstrate" is for the students/employees to demonstrate what they just learned.

### What is Javascript?

#### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates

JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

1.	HTML to define the content of web pages.
2.	 CSS to specify the layout of web pages.
3.	JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages.

### Alert Messages

#### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates

An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.

When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "OK" to proceed.

You can add a button to your webpage by the ```<button>``` tag, followed by an onClick attribute which is linked to a function that is created. 

To add JavaScript in an HTML file, you can use the tag called ```<script>```.

Another way to add JavaScript to an HTML file is to reference it from an external CSS file. 
```js
<script src = "js/script.js"></script>
```
For the code above, you would have to utilize an external javascript file called ```script.js```. 

Below is an example of how the script.js file would look to display an alert message:
```js
alert("Hello world");
```
Below is an example of a simple Try it button:
```html
<script>
function myFunction() {
alert(location.hostname);
}
</script>
```

The alert function allows an alert to appear on screen once you click the button in this case.

### Functions in Javascript

#### Instructor Explains/Demonstrate

The one cool thing that Javascript allows you to do is to perform functions. If by any chance you wanted to find out what 8 + 4 was, you can find the answer using Javascript.

By right clicking a page and going to the console, you are able to perform multiple things such as functions, operations, displaying messages to the screen, etc.
