## Objectives

- Define what Git is.
- Understand Git terms.
- Understand Git commands.


## About

In this unit, you will learn what Git is all about. You will also learn the basic commands for git as well as terms that are always used in the tech field dealing with Git.


## How to use

This will serve as the demonstration instructors will give in regards to what students/employees have learned whether in Treehouse or otherwise. The "Instructor Explains/Demonstrates" section is for the instructor to explain the following topic and there are pre-made examples to use for demonstration purposes. The "Junior Devs Demonstrate" is for the students/employees to demonstrate what they just learned.

### What is Git?

#### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates

Version Control System (VCS) foe tracking changes in computer files.
- Keeps track of code history.
- Takes “snapshots” of your files.
- You decide when to take snapshots by making a “commit”.
- You can visit any snapshot at any time.


### Basic Git Commands

#### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates

It is hard to memorize all the important Git commands by heart, but as time goes by, you'll remember very easily. The most common git commands you'll be using are:

1.	$git init – Initialize Local Repository.
2.	$git add ```<file>``` - Add File(s) to Index.
3.	$git status – Check status of working tree.
4.	$git commit – Commit changes in index.
5.	$git push - Push to remote repository.
6.	$git pull – Pull latest from remote repository.
7.	$git clone – Clone repository into a new directory.


### Terms you need to remember. 

#### Instructor Explains/Demonstrate

- Directory -> Folder
- Terminal or Command Line -> Interface for Text Commands
- CLI -> Command Line Interface
- CD - Change Directory
- Code Editor -> Word Processor for Writing Code
- Repository -> Project, or the folder /place where your project is kept
- Github -> A website to host your repositories 

### Advantage of using Github

#### Instructor Explains/Demonstrate

The social networking aspect of GitHub is probably its most powerful feature, allowing projects to grow more than just about any of the other features offered. Each user on GitHub has their own profile that acts like a resume of sorts, showing your past work and contributions to other projects via pull requests.

Project revisions can be discussed publicly, so a mass of experts can contribute knowledge and collaborate to advance a project forward. Before the advent of GitHub, developers interested in contributing to a project would usually need to find some means of contacting the authors—probably by email—and then convince them that they can be trusted and their contribution is legit.

Using an online repository provides a nice and simple way to have their code and version history available online, regardless of what happens to their local machine. For some people, this is enough, but we stress that a multi solution backup plan is always the best.
