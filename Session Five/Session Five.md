## How to use

This will serve as the demonstration instructors will give in regards to what students/employees have learned whether in Treehouse or otherwise. The "Instructor Explains/Demonstrates" section is for the instructor to explain the following topic and there are pre-made examples to use for demonstration purposes. The "Junior Devs Demonstrate" is for the students/employees to demonstrate what they just learned.

### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates

#### How to add Audio to your webpage.

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.

HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesnâ€™t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates 

#### How to add Video to your webpage.

To create an html file, you must always end the file with the extension html. By ending the file with .html, the file will now be classified as an html file.

#### Junior Devs Demonstrate

Create a file and name is index. When you save the file, make sure you add the .html to the end of the file. The file name should be **"index.html".**

### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates 

#### Embed a video.

All Web pages share a common structure.
```html
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE> Example </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
This is where you would include the text and images on your Web page.
</BODY>
</HTML>
```

#### Junior Devs Demonstrate

### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates 

#### Flex Box

- The essence of HTML programming is tags.
- A tag is a keyword enclosed by angle brackets (Example: ```<B>```)
- There are opening and closing tags for many but not all tags; The affected text is between the two tags.
- The opening and closing tags use the same command except the closing tag contains and additional forward slash /.

#### Junior Devs Demonstrate 

### Next Steps

For the last 15 minutes, try to write a small biography of yourself by using the tags talked about during this lesson. Also, try adding 5 headers of different sizes.
