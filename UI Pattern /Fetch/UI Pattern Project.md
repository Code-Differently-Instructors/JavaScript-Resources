# UI Pattern Project
Here you will combine the skills you have learned in JavaScript to build out user interfaces along with using HTML and CSS.

## Prerequisites

- HTML and CSS
- CSS Layout
- Programming with JavaScript
- Working with the DOM
- API

## Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub called **UI Pattern Project**.
2. Fulfill the listed requirements below.

## Requirements

You will pick one UI Pattern and one API to combine the two. The data to populate the UI Pattern should come from the API. When the user loads the page, they should see the data from the API load into the UI pattern on the screen. You will need to utilize the DOM for interactivity.

## Technical Requirements

Your project should meet the following requirements:

- Your code runs without errors.
- Shows the UI pattern you selected populated with data from the API you
  selected
- Includes a well written README.
- Have a good and frequent commit history.

## UI Pattern

Below you will find a few UI patterns that you will need to choose from as well as an API. After building your UI pattern, you'll then work with an API of your choosing.

### List of UI Patterns

You are **NOT REQUIRED** to copy the **EXAMPLES** below, they are just to show you what each UI pattern is, does and looks like. You may choose from the following list of UI patterns:

#### Modal

A modal showcases when a user clicks on a link, a box/popup should appear in the center of the screen with the details for the item that the user clicks on. The box should also contain a way for the user to close the box.

#### Hamburger Menu

A hamburger icon should be in the top right or left corner. When a user clicks on the menu, a menu should appear from off of the right or left side of the screen and given a list of menu items. When the user clicks on the menu item, the contents on the page should change to show the details for that item. The user should be able to see which item is currently selected and be able to close the menu by clicking the hamburger menu again.

#### Accordion

With an accordion menu, a user should see a list of items. When a menu item is clicked on, the space below the item expands to reveal the content related to that item. When the user clicks on the item again, the revealed content becomes hidden.

#### Tabs

Tabs are when the user sees a row of tabs above a content area. The user should be able to click on one of the tabs, the content in the content area changes based on which tab the user clicked.

#### Slider

A slider menu is when the user should see the content on the screen with 'Next' and 'Previous' directional buttons. When the user clicks on the 'Next' button, the slider should change to show the next item in the list. When the user clicks on the 'Previous' button, the slider should shift to show the previous items in the list. If there is no next or previous items, the slider could loop to the other end of the list or prevent the user from clicking those buttons.

## Choosing and working with an API
In addition to building your UI pattern, you will be utilizing fetch to request information from third-party databases or APIs, generating content on your webpage from third party servers. 

### List of APIs

Below you will find a list of APIs:

1. Marvel: developer.marvel.com
1. Star Wars: [swapi.dev](https://swapi.dev/)
1. Weather: openweathermap.org/api
1. Giphy: developers.giphy.com
1. Pokemon: http://pokeapi.co
1. Google Books: developers.google.com/books
1. City of Chicago: data.cityofchicago.org
1. The Office: https://www.officeapi.dev/
1. Chuck Norris: http://www.icndb.com
1. Rick and Morty: rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest
1. Dad Jokes: icanhazdadjoke.com/api
1. NASA: api.nasa.gov

There is also [this collection of public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).
