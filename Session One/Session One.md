## Objectives

- Define what is HTML.
- Know how to use a text editor.
- Understand how to structure an HTML page.
- Tags.
- Headers.
- Paragraphs.

## About

1.	HTML to define the content of web pages.
2.	 CSS to specify the layout of web pages.
3.	JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages.

## How to use

This will serve as the demonstration instructors will give in regards to what students/employees have learned whether in Treehouse or otherwise. The "Instructor Explains/Demonstrates" section is for the instructor to explain the following topic and there are pre-made examples to use for demonstration purposes. The "Junior Devs Demonstrate" is for the students/employees to demonstrate what they just learned.

### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates

#### What is HTML?

1.	HTML, otherwise known as HyperText Markup Language, is the language used to create Web pages.
2.	Using HTML, you can create a Web page with text, graphics, sound, and video

### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates 

#### Creating a File

To create an html file, you must always end the file with the extension html. By ending the file with .html, the file will now be classified as an html file.

#### Junior Devs Demonstrate

Create a file and name is index. When you save the file, make sure you add the .html to the end of the file. The file name should be **"index.html".**

### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates 

#### How to structure your page

All Web pages share a common structure.
```html
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE> Example </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
This is where you would include the text and images on your Web page.
</BODY>
</HTML>
```

### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates 

#### Tags

- The essence of HTML programming is tags.
- A tag is a keyword enclosed by angle brackets (Example: ```<B>```)
- There are opening and closing tags for many but not all tags; The affected text is between the two tags.
- The opening and closing tags use the same command except the closing tag contains and additional forward slash /.


### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates 

#### Paragraph

- Paragraph is represented by the ```<p></p>``` tag. Paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields. You can use Lorem ipsum to generate random paragraph to just help structure your page for an example.

### Instructor Explains/Demonstrates

#### Headers

- Web pages are typically organized into sections with headings; To create a heading use the expression ```<Hn>â€¦.</Hn>``` where n is a number between 1 and 7.
- In this case, the 1 corresponds to the largest size heading while the 7 corresponds to the smallest size.

#### Junior Devs Demonstrate

### Next Steps

For the last 15 minutes, try to write a small biography of yourself by using the tags talked about during this lesson. Also, try adding 5 headers of different sizes.
