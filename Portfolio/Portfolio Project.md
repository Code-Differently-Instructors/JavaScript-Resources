## Portfolio Project
As a software developer it would behoove you to have more than a resume. A portfolio is to be considered a developer's virtual presence. This is meant to showcase several things: 

- Your development skills to code a website from scratch in your image.
- Showcase who you are as a developer and person.
- Showcase projects you have worked on.
- Explain your skillset and what you are currently or looking to do.

A portfolio is a way to create a personal brand for yourself. When people go on to your portfolio, they not only get to see your work but receive a glimpse into who you are. A software developer's portfolio communicates their skillset, but it’s also a way to showcase your personality, your goals and how you got where you are. Essentially a portfolio can tell employers if you're a good fit for their culture and/or whether you’ll excel in any of their open roles.
